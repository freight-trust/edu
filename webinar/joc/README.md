# Smart Procurement

    <!-- The Narrative Setup -->
    1. Compare "Smart" technologies to previous historical technologies
        slide: 
        working title: Electricity as a "Competitive Advantage"
        let’s take electricity and power generation. 
        These days not many people get worked up about electricity supply - except where of course we talk about disruptive impacts.
        You certainly don’t get large numbers of companies employing thousands of electrical engineers to build personal power generators 
        unless they are in the business of power generation. No-one talks about the strategic value or competitive advantage of electricity 
        - however that was not always the case.

        slide: National Electricity Grid;
        By the 1930’s however we had the national grid, and it was just something we used.
        It was no longer considered important but a cost of doing something. (Cost of Doing Business, CODB)

    <!-- Dispell their currently held expectations -->
    2. IT spending adds to business value == IT reduces cost through automation 
        slide: 
        working title: MYTH 
        Majority of spending is to keep up with competitors and adds no new value What was going on was an IT arms race,
        companies spending simply to keep up with competitors and not linked to value at all. 
        The majority of IT spend was on “essential” systems which competitors had .. it was a cost of doing business, a cost to compete.

    <!-- Smart Procurement: Two Angles; IT & Core Business functions -->
    3. Procurement Decisions
    Cost of Competitive Advantage  (CoCCA) and (CODB) doing business That our industry is in a constant move from CA to CODB and most IT today is CODB - very little is CA. This also means ...
        slide: 
        working title: Midway Point Takeways
        The only advantage that can be gained with CODB is doing it cheaper than your competitors
        that only a small part of IT creates value. Most of IT is a necessity to compete and should be done on lowest cost of ownership basis.

    <!-- Smart Procurement - Buying Core Business functions like you buy IT -->
    4. Procurment on per usage basis 
    Examples:
        Benchmarking your costs against a benchmark index (Drewry Container Freight Index)
        Benchmarking your rate of failure against Industry (Open Stats, freight trust)

    5. Compliance through Procurement
    Examples:
        TradeSure - Free Service from Freight Trust that offers OFAC/FinCEN Checklist (Includes Tankers, etc)
    
    6. Other Procurment functions
    Examples:
        ?
